# Leaflet CSS Import Fix

## 🐛 **The Problem**
Your friends are getting this error:
```
Failed to resolve import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css" from "src/components/MapView.jsx". Does the file exist?
```

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **What I Fixed:**

1. **Removed the problematic import from MapView.jsx**
   - Removed: `import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';`
   - This was causing the Vite import error

2. **Added Leaflet CSS to the main CSS file**
   - Added: `@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';` to `src/index.css`
   - This is the correct way to import CSS in Vite projects

### **For Your Friends to Fix:**

If they're still getting the error, they need to:

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🔧 **Alternative Fix (if still having issues):**

If the above doesn't work, they can manually add this to their `src/index.css` file:

```css
@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

And remove this line from `src/components/MapView.jsx`:
```javascript
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

## 📝 **Why This Happened:**

- Vite has different CSS import handling than Create React App
- Leaflet CSS needs to be imported at the root level, not in components
- This is a common issue when using Leaflet with Vite

## ✅ **Verification:**

The map should now load without errors and display properly with:
- Interactive map tiles
- Location markers
- All styling working correctly

Your friends should now be able to use the map feature without any CSS import errors! 🗺️
